# Bus Stop API
An api for getting every bus service from a specific bus stop.
Part of my larger bus tracking project


## Current features
Takes in the atco code which is a code representing a specific bus stop and returns (for now) every bus associated with that bus stop
## Future plans
- Adding more information to the json output
- Building a database of every bus stop (at least in liverpool) with the respective bus service.
